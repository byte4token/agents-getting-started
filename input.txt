I have a huge list of facts about people from history like Lincon, Jefferson etc. I want to capture the facts using a structured schema like YAGO. Since this is domain specific, there will be many new properties that get created. My biggest challange is how the new properties get pruned and merged. Please run a thorough deep research on the best practises and proven techniques to capture the new properties while balancing property explotion.

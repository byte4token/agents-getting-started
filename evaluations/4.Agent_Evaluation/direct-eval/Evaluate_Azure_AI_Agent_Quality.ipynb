    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample demonstrates how to evaluate an AI agent (Azure AI Agent Service) on these important aspects of your agentic workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intent Resolution: Measures how well the agent identifies the user’s request, including how well it scopes the user’s intent, asks clarifying questions, and reminds end users of its scope of capabilities.\n",
    "- Tool Call Accuracy: Evaluates the agent's ability to select the appropriate tools, and process correct parameters from previous steps.\n",
    "- Task Adherence: Measures how well the agent’s response adheres to its assigned tasks, according to its system message and prior steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For AI agents outside of Azure AI Agent Service, you can still provide th agent data in the two formats (either simple data or agent messages) specified in the individual evaluator samples:\n",
    "- [Intent resolution](https://aka.ms/intentresolution-sample)\n",
    "- [Tool call accuracy](https://aka.ms/toolcallaccuracy-sample)\n",
    "- [Task adherence](https://aka.ms/taskadherence-sample)\n",
    "- [Response Completeness](https://aka.ms/rescompleteness-sample)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time \n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 20 minutes running this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "Creating an agent using Azure AI agent service requires an Azure AI Foundry project and a deployed, supported model. See more details in [Create a new agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=ai-foundry-portal).\n",
    "\n",
    "For quality evaluation, you need to deploy a `gpt` model supporting JSON mode. We recommend a model `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini` for their strong reasoning capabilities.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Important: Make sure to authenticate to Azure using `az login` in your terminal before running this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the sample:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity azure-ai-evaluation\n",
    "```\n",
    "Set these environment variables with your own values:\n",
    "1) **PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING** - The project connection string, as found in the overview page of your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "2) **MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME** - The deployment name of the model for AI-assisted evaluators, as found under the \"Name\" column in the \"Models + endpoints\" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project.\n",
    "3) **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT** - Azure Open AI Endpoint to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "4) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY** - Azure Open AI Key to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "5) **AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION** - Azure Open AI Api version to be used for evaluation.\n",
    "6) **AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID** - Azure Subscription Id of Azure AI Project\n",
    "7) **PROJECT_NAME** - Azure AI Project Name\n",
    "8) **RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME** - Azure AI Project Resource Group Name\n",
    "9) **AGENT_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME** - The deployment name of the model for your Azure AI agent, as found under the \"Name\" column in the \"Models + endpoints\" tab in your Azure AI Foundry project."
